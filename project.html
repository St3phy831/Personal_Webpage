        <p id ="title"><b>BookExchange</b><i> (November 2020)</i></p>
        <p><ul><li>BookExchange is an app that allows people to buy, sell, or trade their books and textbooks.</li>
        <br>
        <li>This app was built using Android Studios, Java, NYT API, and ISBNdb API.</li>
        <br>
        <li>My partners and I worked 2 days per week for around 2 hrs to complete this application as a part of the CodePath Android University program offered in partnership at CSUMB.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The inspiration to build this app came from our love of reading. As college students, we also realized the need for students having access to affordable books or textbooks, which was what lead us to create this app.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Won Best Product Idea at the CSUMB Demo Day!</li></ul></p>

        <p><ul><li>See Music includes a library of 8 songs that are displayed as colors based on frequency in the form of a bar graph and sounds waves.</li>
        <br>
        <li>This app was built using Javascript and implementing the p5.js Sound library.</li>

        <li>My partner and I worked 2 hrs a day for a week to complete this application as a part of Google CSSIx 2020.</li>
        <br>
        <li>The inspiration to build this app came from a Ted Talk video about chromesthesia, which are people who can see music through a spectrum of colors. Because of our astonishment and love of music, me and my partner decided to research this topic and build this app.</li></ul></p>
